%xpressent
Slide 1
 * Please note that .xpr files must start with %xpressent string as first line on the file
 * Notes are displayed on the remote
----------------------
Slide 2
 * More than five '-' characters act as a marker for a new slide in the .xpr file
 * You can read notes and scroll up and down
 * It's as simple as that!

     If a line is indented, and too long to fit in one line, it's automatically splitted and lines in the paragraph keep the indentation.

 - The '-' minus or the '*' star characters can be used for bullets. Long lines are splitted as usual, and identation is kept
    * This is a sub-section
    * This is a another subsection
    * This is the third subsection with a very very very very very long long long line that shouldn't fit in one line
 - Back to the previous indentation

A line containing only the { symbol starts a code (fixed font) section. Put } in a single line to finish it
